        <h1>HAPPY BIRTHDAY RIDDHI!</h1>
    </div>
    <br>
    <p id="letter" style="font-size: larger">Happy 20th to my favourite person! I'm so so lucky to have you as my best friend. From 2 to 20, our bond's just grown stronger and stronger. From playing in the sandpit to having deep conversations , from family trips to friends trips, from going to princess parties to going to new years parties, from meeting regularly to talking on the phone everyday from different cities, we've grown up together and I wouldn't have had it any other way. Thank you for always being there for me, for listening to all my rants and never failing to make me smile. I love laughing like crazy at the stupidest things with you, doing weird shit, and, more than anything, just being me. You're someone I can relate to the most and just talking to you makes me happy. You're extremely weird yet you're genuine and passionate, and I'm so proud of you . You continue to inspire me every single day.
    <br><br>
        Even though I can't meet you despite both of us being in Mumbai, this is a little gift to make you smile! Love you!    </div>
